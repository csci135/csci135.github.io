CSCI 135 SOFTWARE ANALYSIS & DESIGN I FALL 2018
Sections 01 & CSH1: Monday, Thursday 8:10 – 9:25 AM, Hunter North 118
Instructor: Genady Maryash (gmaryash@hunter.cuny.edu)
Office hours: Hunter North 1090-D  
Mondays 9:25 – 10:10 PM, 2:35 - 3:05
Thursdays 9:25 – 10:10 PM  
  
PRE- AND CO-REQUISITES  
The prerequisite is CSCI 127 or instructor’s permission. At the very least, you should have written, compiled, and run a greater than one page long program containing iteration `while`, `for` and selection `if` statements.  CSCI 136 is a co-requisite, and you will receive a 0 in 135 if you don’t take 136. If you have already passed 136, you must contact me before the 2nd class, so that you can be added to a BlackBoard section and your work can be graded.  

TEXT  
Same as CSCI 135: Cay Horstmann, **Brief C++**, 3rd Edition eText/loose-leaf bundle. Purchase at the negotiated discounted price of $47.95 through this direct-to-student page:  [https://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-830954.html](https://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-830954.html)  
This is a new text – different from the previous semester.  It is also better and less expensive.  The eText portion contains useful interactive features.  
  
[MAIN COURSE PAGE](2018_fall.html){:target="_blank"}  
You should check this page regularly, since **all** class materials will be gradually posted here.  

TUTORING  
There are dedicated computer labs for this course (HUNTER NORTH 1001C, 1000E, and 1000B) staffed with tutors, who are there to help you.  Please take advantage of it.  You can ask for help with labs, projects, and general course material 
Monday through Fridays from 9:30 AM to 9:30 PM  

QUESTIONS  
Ask many in lecture!  Outside of lecture go to the tutoring labs.  The department hired additional tutors especially for students taking this course.  Your CSCI 136 instructor is the first point of contact for any questions that a tutor cannot answer.  The beginning of each 136 lab is also devoted to answering questions.  

GRADESCOPE  
You will submit all labs and projects electronicaly through Gradescope.  You will see your grades (including exam grades) on Gradescope as well.  An invite email was sent to you before the first lecture.  If you have not received it, ask your lab instructor to send you another one right away: you will neeed to email them your full name, EMPL ID, and a **good** email address.  

BLACKBOARD  
Make sure that you have configured BlackBoard to use your preferred email address (your Hunter email address, by default), since you are responsible for any email I might send there.  You will also need to be able to connect to BlackBoard from some device (a phone, a tablet, or a laptop) during lectures: lecture quizzes will be administered through BlackBoard.  

SOFTWARE  
You may use 1001C (in CSCI 136) or 1001B to do your work for this course. The standard Linux/Unix/MacOS C++ compiler is g++. If you wish to use a home computer, there are several free Linux OSs which you can install for dual-booting with Windows, including http://www.ubuntu.com . If you want a Linux-style environment for windows that doesn’t require installing Linux, http://cygwin.com is an alternative.  

GRADING  
5% mid-lecture quizzes. 5% programming project I, 10% each projects II and III (this may not seem like a lot, but beware that many exam questions will be based directly on these programs), 30% midterm exam and 40% final exams. However, if you do better on the final exam than on the midterm, your final exam grade will count for 70% of your final grade.  
  
LATE AND MAKE UP POLICY  
There will be absolutely no late project or lab submissions.  No exceptions.  
Make-up exams will not be given under any circumstances.  No exceptions.  
  
GUIDELINES FOR FINAL GRADES  
A: You understand the concepts well enough to successfully understand and solve a problem by implementing a C++ program on your own.
B: Between the above and below.
C: You understand all basic C++ concepts, but have trouble implementing a complete correct program.  
F: You do not understand basic C++ concepts, or are unable to implement programs.  
  
DEPARTMENT LEARNING GOALS  
- Have a deep practical knowledge of one widely used programming language  
- Be experienced in working in at least two widely used operating system environments  
- Be able to apply principles of design and analysis in creating substantial programs and have experience working
in teams on projects of moderately realistic scope  
  
HOW TO LEARN  
• From the beginning, you will be expected to work independently outside of the lectures. There will be very little “hand holding” in the course – you are expected to find your way around your computer on your own – the way each of you will save your work, compile/debug assignments, etc.  Get started NOW – especially if you are going to install your own compiler and/or operating system. The first programming project is due soon.  

• There will be many obstacles to overcome, both in absorbing the material and in doing the assignments. It is difficult to understand software development concepts without sitting in front of a computer many hours a week actually writing and debugging programs. Attacking the obstacles head on, outside of class time, in front of a computer, is the key to success. Keep trying, if your program is not working, try again. Still not working? Try again. And again. And again. When it comes to programming, the learning is in the doing. There is no substitute for spending many hours in front of a computer – trying and failing, trying and failing, trying and failing – until you finally get your program up and running correctly. Every time you fail, you actually learn quite a bit, and to pass the course, you will repeat this trying-failing cycle many times, every week during the entire semester. There are no “slow points” during the semester.  

• There will be three programming projects. By far, the main cause for an unsatisfactory final grade is falling behind on the projects. Exams are largely based on the programming projects. If you don’t do the projects, on time, you will almost certainly not pass the exams.  
  
THIS COURSE IS...  
• An introduction to software development, using the C++ programming language. Software development is a skill involving understanding the problem being modeled, as well as expressing a solution using a programming language. Thus, it has both conceptual and technical components. A successful student will be able to clearly and logically transform a problem, while being comfortable with C++ to express the transformed problem. 

• A preparation for further courses in computer science. This course comprises the ABCs of computer science, and you’re not allowed to forget it anymore than you can forget the alphabet after kindergarten. Students who expect to take more advanced courses in computer science need to go beyond “understanding” the material presented in this course – they need to master it.  

• Time consuming, very, very time consuming. Any programming course takes up a lot of a student’s time. In addition to the time spent in class, most students will need to spend between 10 and 20 hours a week at a computer. That makes for a total of 15-25 hours a week actually writing and debugging programs, no kidding!  

THIS COURSE IS NOT...  
• An introduction to computers in general. We will not cover: operating systems, networks, databases, etc. This course teaches a specialized skill – programming – and only programming. You should already possess basic computer skills such as compiling simple computer programs, editing files, manipulating files, etc.  

• An overview of the C++ language. C++ is a huge language with a lot of highly technical details. We will cover the fundamentals of C++, but the focus is on designing algorithms and solving problems.  

• A good idea to take if you are working full time and taking a full course load, or, for any other reason(s) you don’t have a lot of free time to devote to CSCI 135. The course material requires many, many hours to master (see above). Be honest with yourself. Make sure this course is for you now at this point in your academic life. If you would like to discuss the time requirements further please feel free to come talk with me.  

Other than during lecture quizzes I ask that all cell phones be put away in class. 

We take academic honesty very seriously, and any violation results in an automatic F for the course along with sanctions in accordance with Hunter College procedure.
