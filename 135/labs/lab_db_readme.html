Bugs in the program buggy.cpp
=============================

Part 1. Maximum
---------------

1)  Observation: for loop stops immediately
    Cause:
      Loop condition 
        i > CAPACITY 
      should be
        i < CAPACITY

2)  Observation: if condition does not affect execution (maximum gets updated
    for every next element of the array regardless).
    Cause:
      Semicolon after if condition and before { }


Part 2. Minimum
---------------

3)  Observation: Minimum remains equal to its initial value 0 and never changes.

    Cause:
      Initialization 
        int min_val = 0;
      should be
        int min_val = arr[min_i];

4)  Observation: After fixing the previous bug, the index of the minimum element 
    is still not found correctly (reported 0, while should be 5).

    Cause: In the body of the loop, variable min_i is not updated.
      Instead of 
        max_i = i;
      should be
        min_i = i;


Part 3. Maximum difference
--------------------------

5)  Observations: 
    - Reported difference is a huge random number, and the corresponding index is often 8.
    - Loop iterates beyond the array bounds and compares arr[7] with arr[8], which 
    is out of bounds.

    Cause:
      Instead of 
        for(int i = 0; i < CAPACITY; i++) {
      should be 
        for(int i = 0; i < CAPACITY-1; i++) {

6)  Observation: 
    - Reported difference is still not correct
    - max_diff turns out to be updating on every iteration

    Cause: 
      Wrongly placed curly braces
      
      Correct would be:

        for(int i = 0; i < CAPACITY; i++) {
          int diff = arr[i+1] - arr[i];
          if (diff > max_diff) {    <-------- here
            max_diff_i = i;      
            max_diff = diff; 
          }
        }                           <-------- and here


Part 4. Mean value
------------------

7)  Observations: 
    - Average value is too small (3.5 is reported, while it should be several thousand)
    - Function call to addUp() returns a wrong value
    - Inside that function, sum is not computed correctly
    
    Cause: The function is adding up indexes, not the elements of the array.
      Instead of 
        sum += i;
      should be 
        sum += arr[i];


Part 5. Maximum (revisited)
---------------------------

8)  Observation: 
    - Segmentation fault 
    - index max_i does not get updated correctly
    
    Cause: We update the maximum index with the value of the array at the index i
      Instead of 
        max_i = arr[i];
      should be
        max_i = i;
