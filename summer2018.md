### [CSCI 12700 | Introduction to Computer Science](../summer2018.md)
Hunter College City University of New York &nbsp;Summer 2018  

---

This course presents an overview of computer science (CS) with an emphasis on problem-solving and computational thinking through 'coding': computer programming for beginners. Other topics include: organization of hardware, software, and how information is structured on contemporary computing devices. This course is pre-requisite to several introductory core courses in the CS Major. The course is also required for the CS minor. MATH 125 or higher is strongly recommended as a co-req for intended Majors.

The course has lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays and recitation sections on Mondays and Wednesdays. You must register for both lecture and recitation.

**Course Coordinator and Lecture Instructor:**  
Genady Maryash  
*Office hours: after lecture on Tuesdays and before lecture on Thursdays*

**Tutor/UTA Coordinator:**
